    word_count = check_word_count(content, requirements)
    formatting = check_formatting(content)
    
    # Step 2: Content analysis
    keyword_score = analyze_keywords(content, requirements)
    context_score = assess_context(content, requirements)
    coverage_score = evaluate_coverage(content, requirements)
    organization_score = rate_organization(content)
    specificity_score = measure_specificity(content)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate overall score
    overall = calculate_weighted_score(scores)
    
    # Step 4: Generate feedback
    feedback = generate_feedback(scores, content)
    
    # Step 5: Make recommendation
    action = recommend_action(overall, feedback)
    
    return evaluation_result
